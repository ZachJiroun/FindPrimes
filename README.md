FindPrimes
==========

An Android application that computes prime numbers and allows the user to store them on Google Drive for later reference. It also allows for simple data visualization of prime numbers. To compute prime numbers, I implemented the Sieve of Eratosthenes. I utilized the Google Drive and AndroidPlot APIs, as well as the Google Play Services SDK. I wrote this app over the course of a weekend. If I had more time, I would have implemented Fragments into the application, in addition to creating multiple Activity files in order to create a Dynamic UI and maintain cleaner/more efficient code. Overall, I enjoyed the experience of holding my own hackathon (Unfortunatley, there was no free food or Red Bull).
